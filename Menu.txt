In this note file, sections start with an all-capital word and end with END.
This allows the creation of infinite sections through the menu class and 
also the ability to add notes that have no impact on performance of the
main program (like this block here). Functionality to be added throughout
the term. Whitespace is only signifiant within the sections.

Welcome to Edgedancer!
Story inspired by the book by Brandon Sanderson of the same name.

You are Lift - A quirky young thief who just ran away from the city Azir
where you were an assistant to the leader, Gawx.

You're also a Radiant which means you have supernatural powers. Your powers
are produced with support of your spren, Wyndle, who still doesn't know what
to make of you. Your powers require stormlight to function and you somehow
convert food into stormlight. 

Wyndle follows you around throughout the game. Don't worry - people can't 
see him.

You've arrived at the gates of the city Yeddaw as you heard the crazy
murdering guy you call Darkness is after an unknown radiant in the city. He
recently tried to kill you so this is probably a terrible idea.

Your mission: Identify the radiant and save them from Darkness
Oh. And don't run out of Stormlight. 

You gain access to more powers by earning ideals. These are moral codes to
live by. 

*Note: To gain stormlight from food, you must pick it up as an items
and then use that item from your pack.*

GATES_INTERACT1

Lift:   "There is no way that I'm going to wait in that line."
Wyndle: "Mistress... what are we even doing in this city?"

You look around and see a man with a covered cart full of grain...
What would you like to do?
1. Sneak into the city through the grain cart
2. Probably die of stormin' hunger and wait in line
END

GATES_INTERACT2

You hop into the cart and start eating the raw grain. 
+10% Stormlight

Lift:   "I wish these were pancakes..."
Wyndle: "Isn't this a bit... reckless?"

You reach the front of the line and the guard sees you. Thinking
quickly, you spill the grain all over to distract the guards. 

Wyndle: "We should be on the move! Find a new space!"
Lift:   "I'M SO HUNGRY. Do I smell pancakes in the guard room?"
Wyndle: "How can you even smell that, mistress?"
END

GATES_INTERACT3

You wait in line for FOREVER. 
-35% Stormlight

Lift:   "I'M SO HUNGRY. Do I smell pancakes in the guard room?"
Wyndle: "How can you even smell that, mistress?"
END

GATES_INTERACT4

Lift:   "This place is boring and there's nothing to eat."
END


GUARD_ROOM_INTERACT1

You break into the guard room. You smell food. 

Oh. And you're kinda being chased by guards. 
You become AWESOME to slip through the hands of the guards. 
-5% Stormlight

Wyndle: "Mistress... Can't we just leave without looking for food?"
Lift:   "Quit it, voidbringer. Why can't we do both?"
END

SLUMS_INTERACT1

You see street urchin a few years younger than you huddled in 
a corner. What should you do?

1. Speak to the boy
2. Avoid him
END

SLUMS_SPEAK_TO_BOY1

You spend time with the boy. He tells you that you can find food
and a place to rest at the orphanage north of here.

Urchin: "Thank you. People never listen anymore."

+You've earned the second ideal.
END

SLUMS_SPEAK_TO_BOY2

Urchin: "Don't forget about the orphanage up north for food."
END

MARKET_INTERACT1

You see Darkness in the crowd. That's probably not good.

He kills an Urchin who stole a piece of fruit.
Darkness: "The punishment for theft and assault on an officer of the law
is death!"

You see darkness head into the building to the East.

Wyndle: "Oh Mistress... please don't tell me we're going to follow that 
monster"

You used stormlight in your fright.
-5% Stormlight

Lift:   "I wish that we could climb into that window."
Wyndle: "We could always grow a tree to climb from seeds if you 
still have some."
END

MARKET_INTERACT2

You just see a busy market.
END

HIDEOUT_INTERACT1

You broke into Darkness's hideout!

You overhear Darkness talking to his two minions and one bald
scary looking guy about the other Radiant in town. They said something
about how the Grand Indicium is doing work for them. Whatever that 
means.

Wyndle: "That's it right? We can leave now?"
Lift:   "Nope. There's something I still need to do."
Wyndle: "Oh don't tell me..."
Lift:   "YUP. I'm gonna eat. his. dinner."
END


HIDEOUT_INTERACT2

All those scary people left. Better get moving before they
catch the other radiant.
END

232_INTERACT1

The scary bald guy is there and notices you!
Just when you think you're about to die, he talks to you.

Assassin in White: "My master is mistaken. I do not believe you deserve
to die. Our research into the other radiant points us toward someone
who is always by the Ampitheatre. I must warn you, little radiant:
You don't stand a chance against my master."
END

232_INTERACT2

Better get moving! There's a radiant to save near the ampitheatre.
END


AMPITHEATRE_INTERACT1

You get to the ampitheatre, but it must be too late. You see two dead
bodies.

Wait. Those are two of the minions!

The old man is there and you realize that he is actually made up of many 
interlocking cremlings. 

Old Man: "Don't worry - I took care of those minions. The radiant you seek 
to save is in the Orphanage."
END

AMPITHEATRE_INTERACT2

You see an old man.

1. Talk to him
2. Avoid him
END

AMPITHEATRE_INTERACT3

You speak to the old man.

Old man: "Try not to judge the woman who runs the orphanage. She
may seem brash, but she's really something special."

He then starts talking philosophy... Time to go!
END

AMPITHEATRE_INTERACT4

The old man is still blabbering on about philosophy...
END

ORPHANAGE_INITIAL_INTERACT

You meet the woman in charge, Stump, and she is super mean. Always yelling at 
kids for "faking" their illnesses so that they can scam food out of her.

Stump:  "I know trouble when I see it and you're trouble. I'll 
help you and give you 3 meals, but no more after that."

What would you like to do?
1. Eat meal 1/3
2. Leave
END

ORPHANAGE_MEAL

You accept the meal from Stump.
+18% Stormlight
END

ORPHANAGE_FOOD_INTERACT_2_OF_3

Stump:  "I know trouble when I see it and you're trouble. You're 
running out of meals here"

What would you like to do?
1. Eat meal 2/3
2. Leave
END

ORPHANAGE_FOOD_INTERACT_3_OF_3

Stump:  "This is your last meal. Take it or leave it"

What would you like to do?
1. Eat meal 3/3
2. Leave
END

ORPHANAGE_OUT_OF_FOOD

Stump:  "I told you. 3 meals. That's it. Now scram"
END


ORPHANAGE_ATTACK

You realized that Stump is the radiant and has been healing the 
kids unknowling all along.

Unfortunately, Darkness knows this too and beat you to the Orphanage.

You find Stump on the ground in a pool of blood.

What do you do?
1. Attempt to heal Stump
2. Go after Darkness
END

ORPHANAGE_HEAL

You attempt to heal Stump and it was successful.

Stump: "Thank you. He ran up to the roof!"

+You've earned the third ideal.
END

ORPHANAGE_HEAL2

Stump: "Thank you for healing me. He ran up to the roof!"
END

ORPHANAGE_FAIL

You attempt to heal Stump and it was not successful... Not enough
stormlight.

Wyndle: "What was that noise on the roof?"
END


ROOF_WIN

You find darkness on the roof who attacks you, but are able to block 
his attack with Wyndle who turned into a stick. Wait. A stick? 

Darkness: "I must kill you to prevent the end of the world! The
voidbringers cannot return and your kind will bring them back!"
Lift:     "Can't you see?! They've already returned!"

You manage to convince him that the Voidbringers have returned and he
disappears into the night. 

You Win!
END

ROOF_LOSE

You find darkness on the roof who attacks you.

You die, of course.
Game over.
END

ROOF_BASIC

It's just a roof. Nothing to see up here.
END



INDICIUM_INITIAL

Lift:   "Wow this place is huge. What do people do with this 
many books?"
Wyndle: "...they read them, Mistress."
Lift:   "Who has time for that?"

The scribes are about to call the guard. I guess you look out
of place.
What do you do?

1. Convince the scribes to contact Azir to prove who you are
2. Run
END

INDICIUM_RUN

You try to run, but run into Darkness who kills you.
Game over.
END

INDICIUM_AZIR

Azir responds on the spanreed and says something to 
make the scribes all jumpy. 

Scribes are weird.

Scribe: "I think I'm required to tell you that we were
investigating for these people you're hiding from... That
work was down in room 232."
END

INDICIUM_STD

Just a lot of books.
END


HIDEOUT_WRONG_ENTRANCE

You break in through the front door and come face to face with Darkness.

Who kills you.
Of course.
Game over.
END


OUT_OF_STORMLIGHT

You run out of stormlight and faint. Darkness finds and kills you.

Game over.
END
